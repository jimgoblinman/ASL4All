## Slogan
Inclusivity is only a problem if we make it one!
 
We offer everyone the possibility to understand sign language and be able to speak with a vast community :3
 
How can we pull this off?
 
With our state of the art AI model we are able to identify sign language and translate it 4 all.
 
The QR code allows for the app to be shared more easily as the QR code redirects to a web page so that nothing has to be downloaded.
 
This will help the app spread like wild fire.
